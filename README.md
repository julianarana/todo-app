# todo-app
## Description
This app is intended to be a demo of a ToDo list. It allows the user to check from a ToDo List, which items has been completed.

The items are sorted in three sets. The first is the past due elements that has not been completed, the second one contains the not completed elements and the third one contains all the elements that have been completed.

The application uses Redux to handle the state and fetches the information from a mocked API.
